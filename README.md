Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) play a pivotal role in the chemical and process industries due to their steady-state operational capabilities. This study delved into the influence of initial temperature on the dynamics of a CSTR system. Focusing on the reaction A+Bâ†’P, which follows a second-order rate law, the role of temperature in reaction kinetics, as described by the Arrhenius equation, was examined. The study explored the initial temperature impact on the reactant and product concentrations and the overall temperature by simulating the reactor's behavior using MATLAB and varying the initial temperature. Key findings revealed that the initial temperature profoundly affects reaction rates, time to reach steady states, and the overall behavior of the reactor. Multiple steady states were observed in some cases, highlighting the complexities inherent in reactor dynamics. This research underscores the importance of understanding the implications of initial temperature, providing crucial insights for optimizing reactor performance, safety, and design strategies in industrial applications.
